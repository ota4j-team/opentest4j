/**
 * <p>
 * The serializer package contains classes which will ensure that serializable representations of objects exists. This
 * does not necessarily mean that they can be rebuild after serialization as is but to provide necessary information for
 * debugging an application.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The most relevant use case are tests which do not behave the same on your local machine as in your continuous
 * integration build. And it is most typical for higher level tests like integration and system tests where the state of
 * the system might influence the test result. So for example for Web UI tests it might be important to provide the DOM
 * structure of the current document under test as well as a screenshot.
