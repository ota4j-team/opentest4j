/**
 * A test fixture adds behavior before and after a test method, or set of test methods.
 * It may perform necessary setup or cleanup for tests, or it may verify that some
 * condition holds true after a test (or set of tests) runs without throwing an
 * exception. Test fixtures are designed to allow the creation of reusable and composable
 * test components.
 *
 * To make writing test fixtures easier, you can use {@link SimpleTestFixture}.
 *
 * To see how test fixtures can be useful, see these provided fixtures.
